# About the Padimo Mini
I have too many ideas and not enough time near my printer. 
Target speed: 40 mm/s
Target print volume: 50mm x 50mm x 60mm
Materials: PLA

# day 1 (2/15/25)
Coming up with ideas to maximize print volume inside of my 10 by 10 by 10 constraints.
First off, the PMU has to be detatchable. There's no way it will fit otherwise.
Second, the extruder is going to be very big relative to the printer itself. So that's going to be detatchable too. 
X and Y will need pulleys and Z will need a screw, it's unavoidable.
the screen can cover one face so that's fine. but it means that i'll need a touchscreen because rotary encoders are too big, so Adafruit ILI9341 touchscreen with microSD socket?

now i need a mainboard that uses SPI for both the card and the screen. and is 100mm or less. not happening
